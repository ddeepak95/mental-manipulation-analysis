# Analysis of Mental Manipulation in Conversations using ConvoKit

The dataset from [MentalManip: A Dataset For Fine-grained Analysis of Mental Manipulation in Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16584) converted into the ConvoKit format has been used for analysis. In the original dataset, the conversations are labeled with the manipulation techique used in the conversation. 

The [PromptTypes](https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/promptTypes.html) transformer from the ConvoKit is used for doing the analysis. The PromptTypes in ConvoKit to cluster the utterances into categories based on the rhetorical intentions. Then the correlation between the Prompt Type and the manipulation techique is checked using standard statistical methods.
